Features

-The navigation feature allows users to select the pages easily with the buttons at the top so they can navigate between pages

-The navigation feature is designed to be sticky so that it will stay at the top of the tab while the user scrolls down. This is so that the user does not need to go through the trouble of scrolling up again to navigate

-The links feature allows users to go to other websites and it opens a new tab instead of changing the tab to the website so it is more convenient as the user does not need to click the go back button to the website
